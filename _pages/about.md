# 2014 - August

I was childlishly amazed when, two years ago, I got a chance to spend ten days in Tokyo. Japan was, for me, always been a synonim for challenging, exciting, far away destination, blend of variety, tradition, taboo and urban. Inspirational, but seeminly unreachable country.Experiences from touristic visits gave new colors to my thoughts and ideas from movies... Fascinations filled out every day, I was discovering much of what I don't understand, but worthy of every respect. I was facing terrifying lack of communication, and with it, enormous effort of Japanese people to make your guest visit fun, friendly and pleasent. I discovered things and feelding that one can only find in Japan, every day feeling of pleasent living, becuase everything in Japan is ordered, clean and first of all humain. 

Once we got the offer to move to Japan, we had an easy decision. 

We never moved out of Serbia, and I believe this will be a special experience, and with communication barriers, it all smells like a real advanture. Knowing all that Japan offer, I believe we will never be bored, will be surrounded by challenges and opportunities, and we'll eventually get to meet some new us. 

Nippon and me (Serbian: Nippon i ja) - This blog is my idea to share it all with close friends and those who might find our experience interesting. We want to bring everyday life, troubles, joy, travel, friends, photos and details to you. 

# 2020 - March

For quite some time, we've been talking about translating original blog, written in Serbian, to English and allowing our international friends to enjoy in Japan as much as our family and Serbian friend. 

This website and page is attempt to do that in a a bit of a different, modern format.
