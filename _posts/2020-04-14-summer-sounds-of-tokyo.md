My earlier visits to Tokyo were in the winter days. I did not get to know the green side of the city, I used to visit parks and gardens during the dormant period of vegetation, rare tree-lined avenues blended into the winter color scheme. Walks in the business districts revealed small, neat oases next to the multi-storey building, hinting at refreshments in the summer days. Residents of many houses have confirmed the Japanese skill that they are unrivaled in scarce conditions, as they most often carefully nurture potted plants and trees, in the absence of a yard. This in no way diminished the impression of the exterior. It just seemed to me to be insufficient connection with nature from the perspective of a almost-Shumadinka…

Tokyo – could it be more urban?

However, on the first night of our summer stay Tokyo also offered a greener face. The lush, vividly planted and imaginatively lighted shrubs and trees a little soothed my anxieties about how everyday decor would look like. But a completely unexpected turnaround brought us a new, unusual sound of the metropolis ... the sound of cicadas.

All the canopy, every greenery is occupied by these large insects. My impression is that in the evenings they are noticeably louder or at least noticeable, every stay outside is accompanied by dominant advertising. They migrate after the rainy season and are present during the summer.

Tokyo is a quiet city, quite a quiet one for bigger metropolis. The discreet chirping from the street to our open window on the 16th floor was accompanied by a smiles ... a familiar sound of summer, by no means urban. This city never ceases to amaze ...

Um ... luckily they only feed on tree sap!
