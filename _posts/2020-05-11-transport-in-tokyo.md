Although very frightening, the map of Tokyo transportation is a necessary collaborator for every visitor to this divided city. It is used every day, and it is easy to get used to, because it is a real pleasure to travel with such a clean, tidy, functional transport. No delay ... Railways, densha (電車) and metros, chikatetsu (地下 鉄) are mostly used, which is also shown on the map. Although there are also bus and tram lines, which are more burdened by the traffic situation. This can cause a delay of a few minutes, so the right Japanese are not the best choice. However, they are more reliable in the days when the railway lines are canceled due to heavy rains and storms.

JR East is the railway company behind the most important JR Yamanote line, Yamanote-sen.

I advise every visitor to invest in SIM card, as internet offers endless discounts, information and shortcuts in this city. SIM card costs around 30 EUR. 

Getting around at smaller train stations usually boils down to choosing one of the two exists. If a station is a big hub, and if you need to change the train companies, there's some planning in the game. Getting around is further complicated by the fact that many of the stations house shopping malls, so there's endless passages, exits and additional content to distract. It's improtant that you'll carefully follow train line signs and directions, especially platforms that tell the direction of the train. Picture below shows layout of Tokyo station.

The moment when Google helps a lot is the situation when an express train arrives, it travels in the right direction, but does not stop at the desired station. It is of course written on the train, but in an unknown language. Google always recommends the right train and it's just important to keep track of time. The train didn't arrive early, it just wasn't the one you need. We have practiced this several times ...

At the station exits, there is usually a map that shows where each gate exits. A new map often follows on the street, showing the neighborhood. As expected, the north is not up, but the map is a projection of what is in front of the observer. It can be helpful if you follow the map in the tourist guide in parallel, which is always facing the north.

The price of transportation in Tokyo is in any case an attack on the budget, so a walk is always welcome for shorter distances, and it also offers an opportunity to see the city from different perspective. The ride can be paid in different ways, but the most recommended is the prepaid card system, which is simply charged by bringing the card to the reader at the gate. We use [Suica](http://www.jreast.co.jp/e/pass/suica.html).

A certain amount of money is deposited on the card, and can be topped up as needed, and there are a large number of shops, attractions and content that accept it as a method of payment. Mixture of debit and bus ticket.

During rush hour, transportation is crowded. A river of people flows through the station, and the train dispatcher packs the passengers with graceful movements in white gloves. Passengers form two columns to the left and right of the door, leaving space for those exiting, and respecting the order in which they arrived in front of the car. However, with kind smiles, pushing is relentless, and they are equally not interested in filling the middle of the car, but squeezing at the door. There is no talking, no phone calls in the transport, the ring is muted. Trains are safe, no pickpocketing or petty crime. The Japanese are very careful about other people's things, willing to help if they are asked for help. Women sometimes feel uncomfortable because of groping and pushing by men, especially when it's crowded. That is why the first wagons are reserved only for women during rush hour ...
